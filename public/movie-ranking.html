     <h3>The Oak Room</h3>
     <p>The film is a master class in developing tension using limited settings and only 2 characters. I found myself on the edge of my seat until the very end of the film.</p>
     <h3>Scare Me</h3>
     <p>Simple premise of a power outage and neighbors telling scary stories, but things escalate quickly.</p>
     <h3>Scare Tactics</h3>
     <p>The interplay of the horror anthology movie with a wraparound story that shows reverence to the classics with just the right amount of camp.</p>
